name: Modules.Map.Route
summary: Represents a path between two or more points of interest.
description: |
    The `Route` object gives you low-level control over routes that can be added to a
    [map view](Modules.Map.View). A route must have its `points` property set to appear on a map.

    Use the <Modules.Map.createRoute> method to create a route.

    ### iOS Platform Notes

    The `addRoute` method no longer accepts a dictionary as a parameter. Pass a <Modules.Map.Route> object instead.
    
    ### Android Platform Notes
    The parameter `points` accepts additional the route in format `encoded polyline`.
