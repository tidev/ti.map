name: Modules.Map.Camera
summary: A camera object defines a point above the map's surface from which to view the map. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.
description: |
    Applying a camera to a map has the effect of giving the map a 3D-like appearance.
    You can use a camera to rotate the map so that it is oriented to match the user's
    heading or to apply a pitch angle to tilt the plane of the map.

    If the app is run on pre iOS 7, camera functionality will not be available.
    After creating a `Camera` object, it can be applied to the map by setting the `camera` property of the
    [map view](Modules.Map.View).

    Use the <Modules.Map.createCamera> method to create a camera.

    If `altitude`, `eyeCoordinate`, and `centerCoordinate` are passed in on creation, a camera will be
    returned using the specified viewing angle information.

    ### Example:
    ``` javascript
    var camera = Map.createCamera({
        altitude: 15.5,
        centerCoordinates: {
            longitude: 151.276417,
            latitude: -33.891614
        },
        heading: 45,
        pitch: 75
    });
    mapview.camera = camera;
    ```

properties:
  - name: altitude
    summary: |
        The altitude above the ground, measured in meters.
        On Android these zoom values are:
            1: World
            5: Landmass/continent
            10: City
            15: Streets
            20: Buildings

    type: Number

  - name: centerCoordinate
    summary: |
        The coordinate point on which the map should be centered.
    type: MapPointType

  - name: heading
    summary: |
        The heading of the camera (measured in degrees) relative to true north.
    description: |
        The value 0 means that the top edge of the map view corresponds to true north.
        The value 90 means the top of the map is pointing due east. The value 180 means
        the top of the map points due south, and so on.
    type: Number

  - name: pitch
    summary: |
        The viewing angle of the camera, measured in degrees.
    description: |
        A value of 0 results in a camera pointed straight down at the map. Angles greater than
        0 result in a camera that is pitched toward the horizon by the specified number of degrees.
        The value in this property may be clamped to a maximum value to maintain map readability.
        There is no fixed maximum value, though, because the actual maximum value is dependent on
        the current altitude of the camera.
    type: Number

  - name: eyeCoordinate
    summary: |
        The coordinate point at which to place the camera. Only used on creation when `altitude`
        and `centerCoordinate` are also provided. Setting this property at anytime other time will
        have no effect.
    description: |
        If the value for this parameter is equal to the value in the `centerCoordinate` parameter,
        the map is displayed as if the camera is looking straight down. If this point is offset
        from the `centerCoordinate` value, the map is displayed with an appropriate heading and pitch angle.
        Not used on Android.
